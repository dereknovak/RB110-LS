## 1

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
counter = 0

loop do
  break if counter == numbers.size
  puts numbers[counter]
  counter += 1
end
```
On line 1, local variable `numbers` is initialized and references an array object with the elements `[1, 2, 3]`. On line 2, local variable `counter` is initialized and references the integer `0`.

On line 5, the `loop` method is invoked and gets passed a `do...end` block as an argument, creating a loop between lines 6-8. Upon each iteration of the loop, a `break if` condition is set if the value of `counter` is the same size as the `numbers` array, the current index of `numbers` will output (specified by `counter`), and `counter` will increment by `1`. Because there are 3 elements in the `numbers` array, this loop will execute 3 times, outputting each of its elements to the console.

## 2

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
```
In this example, the `each` method is called on the array object `[1, 2, 3]` and gets passed a `do...end` block as an argument, binding each element to the block's parameter `num` throughout iteration. Upon each iteration of the block, `num`, representing the current element, is output by invocation of the `puts` method. As a result, each element of the calling array object will be output on separate lines.
