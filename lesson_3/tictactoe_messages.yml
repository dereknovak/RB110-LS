  ====== INSTRUCTIONS ======

  - The familiar game you love, now brought to you as a computer program! Each player takes turns placing their tile in one of the 9 squares. First player to get 3 in a row wins!
  
  ======== GAMEPLAY ========

  - Input '1' to begin playing game.
  - Determine the difficulty of the game. (See "DIFFICULTY MODES" for details)
  - Select the number of total rounds played. Because a winner is determined by having more wins than the other, only an odd number of rounds can be created.

     Best of 3           Best of 5
  Must win 2 games    Must win 3 games

  - Select whether the Player or Computer has the first move. Each subsequent round, the LOSING player goes first. If a tie is determined, the round is repeated with a random player starting.
  
  - When placing a tile, input an integer between 1-9. Each square is represented by a specific integer, as indicated below:

       |     |
    1  |  2  |  3
       |     |
  -----+-----+-----
       |     |
    4  |  5  |  6
       |     |
  -----+-----+-----
       |     |
    7  |  8  |  9
       |     |

  - Each player takes turns placing a tile in an empty square until a winner is determined or the board is filled.

  ======= HOW TO WIN =======

  - A winning game can be achieved with 3 consecutive tiles either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

      Horizontal           Vertical             Diagonal

       |     |              |     |              |     |      
    X  |  X  |  X        X  |     |           X  |     |
       |     |              |     |              |     |      
  -----+-----+-----    -----+-----+-----    -----+-----+-----
       |     |              |     |              |     |      
       |     |      OR   X  |     |       OR     |  X  |      
       |     |              |     |              |     |      
  -----+-----+-----    -----+-----+-----    -----+-----+-----
       |     |              |     |              |     |      
       |     |           X  |     |              |     |   X   
       |     |              |     |              |     |      

  - If all squares are filled and no winner is present, the game is considered a 'tie' and the round will repeat.

  - After winning more than half of the total rounds, the winner is named the GRAND CHAMPION.

  ==== DIFFICULTY MODES ====

  - Beginner
    - The computer randomly places their tiles.

  - Medium
    - The computer develops a more defensive approach, blocking a potential winning square if given the opportunity.

  - Hard
    - Along with being defensive, the computer develops a more offensive approach, going for a winning move if given the opportunity.

  - Expert
    - Along with being both offensive and defensive, the computer will prioritize important squares to maximize their gambit.
